# SIGNBOARD-BASED-SPEED-CONTROL

A real-time traffic sign recognition system using computer vision and deep learning. This project detects traffic signboards (like speed limits, stop signs, crosswalks) and dynamically adjusts vehicle behavior using a Raspberry Pi for motor control. Ideal for smart vehicle and autonomous drivingÂ applications.
